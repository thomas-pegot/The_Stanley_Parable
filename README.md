Event: Rick Sanchez has taken Morty on another adventure, this time to a strange office building where they come across a sentient computer program called "The Narrator." The Narrator tells them about a game called "The Stanley Parable," in which Morty will play the character of Stanley.

Story: Morty, as Stanley, is given a series of choices and must navigate through the office building and make decisions about which path to take. At each fork in the road, Morty must decide whether to follow the Narrator's instructions or to go against them and forge his own path. As he progresses through the game, Morty begins to question the nature of free will and the role that he is playing in the Narrator's story.

Question: "Morty, what do you think you're doing?" asks Rick. "Are you just going to follow the Narrator's script like a good little puppet, or are you going to make your own choices and see where they take you?"

Optional decisions:

    Follow the Narrator's instructions
    Go against the Narrator's instructions and explore the office building on your own
    Try to find a way to escape the office building
    Confront the Narrator and demand to know why you are being forced to play this game.

Event: As Morty follows the Narrator's instructions, he finds himself entering a room filled with hundreds of buttons and levers. The Narrator tells him that he must choose which ones to press in order to progress through the game.

Story: Morty hesitates, unsure of what to do. He knows that his choices will have consequences, but he doesn't know what they will be. Eventually, he decides to trust the Narrator and starts pressing buttons and pulling levers at random. As he does so, the room around him begins to change, doors opening and closing, walls shifting and reconfiguring.

Question: "Morty, are you sure this is the right thing to do?" asks Rick. "What if pressing these buttons and pulling these levers has unintended consequences? Have you thought this through?"

Optional decisions:

    Continue following the Narrator's instructions and pressing the buttons and levers
    Refuse to follow the Narrator's instructions and leave the room
    Try to figure out a logical pattern for pressing the buttons and pulling the levers
    Ask the Narrator for more information about the game and how it works.

Event: As Morty tries to figure out a logical pattern for pressing the buttons and pulling the levers, he becomes increasingly frustrated. No matter what he does, the room remains unchanged and the Narrator's instructions seem to make no sense.

Story: Rick, growing tired of Morty's indecision, decides to take matters into his own hands. He begins pressing buttons and pulling levers at random, causing the room to become even more chaotic. Morty watches in horror as Rick's actions seem to have no effect on the game.

Question: "Rick, what are you doing?" asks Morty. "You're not helping things by just pressing buttons and pulling levers randomly! We need to think this through and come up with a plan."

Optional decisions:

    Continue trying to figure out a logical pattern for pressing the buttons and pulling the levers
    Join Rick in pressing buttons and pulling levers at random
    Try to find a way out of the room without relying on the buttons and levers
    Confront the Narrator and demand to know why the game is not responding to your actions.

Event: Morty confronts the Narrator and demands to know why the game is not responding to their actions. The Narrator simply smiles and tells them that the game is designed to be unpredictable and that they must find their own way through it.

Story: Frustrated and angry, Morty and Rick decide to leave the room and try to find their own way out of the office building. They explore the corridors, searching for any sign of an exit. As they wander, they begin to hear strange noises and see strange sights, causing them to question whether they are still in the game or if something more sinister is at play.

Question: "Rick, do you think we're still in the game?" asks Morty. "Or have we stumbled into something else entirely? What if we can't find a way out of here?"

Optional decisions:

    Keep searching for a way out of the office building
    Try to find a way to communicate with the Narrator and ask for help
    Go back to the room with the buttons and levers and try a different approach
    Explore the strange noises and sights, hoping to find a clue about what is going on.

Event: As Morty and Rick explore the strange noises and sights, they come across a group of office workers huddled in a corner, whispering to each other in fear. They tell Morty and Rick that they have been trapped in the office building for weeks, unable to leave or escape the game.

Story: Horrified by this revelation, Morty and Rick decide to do whatever it takes to find a way out. They search every corner of the building, trying every door and every passage, hoping to find a way out. As they do so, they are confronted by a series of challenges and obstacles, each one more difficult than the last.

Question: "Morty, do you think we'll ever find a way out of here?" asks Rick. "We've been searching for days and it seems like every time we think we're getting closer to an exit, something else gets in our way. What are we supposed to do?"

Optional decisions:

    Keep searching for a way out, no matter how long it takes
    Try to find a way to communicate with the Narrator and ask for help
    Go back to the room with the buttons and levers and try a different approach
    Give up and accept that you are trapped in the game forever.

Event: Morty and Rick go back to the room with the buttons and levers, determined to find a new approach to solving the game. They spend hours pressing buttons and pulling levers, trying every combination they can think of.

Story: As they work, they begin to notice a pattern in the way the room changes. They realize that certain buttons and levers are connected to specific doors and walls, and that by pressing the right combination, they can open new pathways and reach new areas of the office building.

Question: "Morty, do you think we're getting closer to finding a way out?" asks Rick. "I think we're making progress, but we still have a long way to go. Do you think we can do it?"

Optional decisions:

    Keep pressing buttons and pulling levers, hoping to find a way out
    Take a break and rest, then come back to the room later with a fresh perspective
    Explore the office building to see if there are any other clues or hints that might help

Event: Morty and Rick, feeling defeated, decide to give up and accept that they are trapped in the game forever. They sit down and resign themselves to their fate, no longer willing to fight against the Narrator's control.

Story: As they sit in silence, the room around them begins to change once again. The walls and doors shift, and a bright light fills the room. The Narrator's voice echoes through the building, telling Morty and Rick that they have won the game and that they are free to leave.

Question: "Morty, do you believe it?" asks Rick. "Are we really free to go? I can't believe we made it through all of this."

Morty and Rick decide to leave the office building and go back home. As they walk out the front door, they are greeted by the bright sunshine and the sound of birds chirping. They take a deep breath of fresh air and feel a sense of relief wash over them. They had survived the game and were now free to return to their normal lives.

As they make their way back to Rick's portal gun, they can't help but wonder what other adventures and challenges awaited them in the future. But for now, they were just happy to be home and safe.
